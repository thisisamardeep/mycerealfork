Get a working flow ready

Flow is working now--->

Get function call log and include graph of this flow
Get concept and make some articles on that concept

https://pabloariasal.github.io/2020/01/02/static-variable-initialization/ do these concepts fully

/usr/bin/g++   -MM -H  -I/home/amardeep/Desktop/mysources/mycerealfork/include  -std=gnu++17  -c /home/amardeep/Desktop/mysources/mycerealfork/main.cpp
/usr/bin/g++ -E -x c++ - -v -I/home/amardeep/Desktop/mysources/mycerealfork/include  -std=gnu++17  -c /home/amardeep/Desktop/mysources/mycerealfork/main.cpp



======

Most vexing parse topic needs to explain
 function declaration need to explain
  need to understand functioin ppinters and mention they are something different
need to write on function pointers in c and cpp
